####  ISDA SIMM v2.7 Parameters updated for this calculation by Abukar Ali. Date: 2025-06-23

To calcute an initial margin required from a given counterparty for uncleared derivative trades
that qualify to post Iniitial margin using the ISDA Method.  we will require the following: 

- standard input file that contains sensitify data such as delta, gamma, vega for all traded derivative positions
- from the bank's Front office system. such data are aggregated into CRIF file which used an input file for SIMM calculation.
- Next, we will need to read the latest or most recent risk weights and parameters defined by ISDA for SIMM calculations. 
- in this repository, we have a file called v2_7.py - a python input file that has contains all the ISDA Defined risk weights, correlation input data, etc  
- this would take a long time to manually input these data, we have used the 2023 file which contained numbering for the relant section of the data from the ISDA PDF
- i have then used the older file as a guide and asked Deepseek to populate the file using the 2024 updated data - the result was amazing. 

**** DeepSeek Helped Reduce manual input time to only 5 minutes. 

*** (but initially, sometime is required for prompting and QA checks)

- ChatGPT was full of errors and didnt even follow the format of the required file, but with the correct prompt, Deepseek was spot on and 
- as required, it only too few minutes.  Obviously, We dont rely on this fully, so we made sure, we read the pdf line by line and cross check to ensure, all is 100% correct.  
  
  
      INCORRECT or any MIsspecication can lead to impact on your SIMM calculaton - 
      there is always a risk that something is mistyped which can happen both via deepseek or by manual entry.  

 - the resposity we have all the files we need:  

  - aggregate margins.py files
  - aggregate sensitivies.py files
  - margin risk.py files
  - source folder:  contains wnc.py:  this is the file you need to specify that you are using the v2_7.py file. 

 - ok so, once we have the inputs- both the CRIF and v2_7.py, and all the above files 

- we use the main file to run our final SIMM Calculations. Table below shows an output of the SIMM calculations. 

- NOTE, since we do not have actuall sensitivy data, we have created a synthetic data to allow the calculation. but you can easilly update CRIF file for the real thing :-)

ISDA SIMM v2.7 Parameters updated. Date: 2024-12-07



## Getting Started
  - the ISDA defined input data is saved under the file v2_7 under weights_and_corr folder. 

  - Run python -m main
